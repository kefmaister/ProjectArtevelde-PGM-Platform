# ProjectArtevelde-PGM-Platform
Built a new course website platform in 1 month using React &amp; GraphQL for a dynamic &amp; user-friendly experience. Material-UI ensured a sleek interface. Features could include course info, interactive assignments &amp; communication tools. A project that boosted my web dev skills &amp; improved the learning experience for classmates!
